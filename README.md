# AP-Module-Cpp-Tuesday-Exercises
This repository contains the Tuesday exercises from the 'Advanced Programming Module'.

## Exercise 1: ReverseWord
I created a simple C++ program that reverses a user entered word. The program prompts the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays the word in reverse. 

This is my own algorithm created by using a while loop to reverse the word and here is the example output:
```
Please enter a word: Programming
Programming spelt backwards is: gnimmargorP
```

## Exercise 2: LowerCase Converter
I created a simple C++ program that converts a user entered word to lower case. The program prompts the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays the message below and shows the word in lower case.
```
Please enter a word: MaDaM
MaDaM converted to lower case is: madam
```

## Exercise 3: Palindrome Checker
I created a simple C++ program that checks whether a word is a palindrome, i.e., a word that reads the same forwards or backwards. The program prompts the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays a message indicating whether the word was a palindrome or not.
```
Please enter a word: Company
Sorry, ‘Company’ is not a palindrome.

Please enter a word: RaceCar
Yes, ‘RaceCar’ is a palindrome

Please enter a word: madam
Yes, ‘madam’ is a palindrome
```
