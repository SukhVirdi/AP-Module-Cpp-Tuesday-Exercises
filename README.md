# AP-Module-Cpp-Tuesday-Exercises
This repo is part of my 'Advanced Programming' module. It contains all of the Tuesday exercises / challenges.
## Exercise 1: ReverseWord
I created a simple C++ program that reverses a user entered word. The program prompts the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays the word in reverse. 

This is my own algorithm created by using a while loop to reverse the word and here is the example output:
```
Please enter a word: Programming
Programming spelt backwards is: gnimmargorP
```

## Exercise 2: LowerCase Converter
I created a simple C++ program that converts a user entered word to lower case. The program prompts the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays the message below and shows the word in lower case.
```
Please enter a word: MaDaM
MaDaM converted to lower case is: madam
```

## Password Validator
Passwords are validated by comparing a user-provided value with a known, stored value – passwords are either correct or not. Create a simple C++ program that validates user login credentials. This program prompts the user for a username and password and compare them against already known credentials. If the username provided exists and the password matches the program displays “Welcome” followed by the users first name. If the username does not exist or the password is incorrect a “Failed to Authenticate” message is shown.
```
Username: mike@ada.ac
Password: AdaRocks

Welcome Mike

--OR--

Username: casper@ada.ac
Password: AdaRocks

Failed to Authenticate
```
