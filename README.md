# AP-Module-Cpp-Tuesday-Exercises
This repo is part of my 'Advanced Programming' module. It contains all of the Tuesday exercises / challenges.
## Exercise 1: ReverseWord
I created a simple C++ program that reverses a user entered word. The program prompts the user for a
single word. Once entered, the program displays the word in reverse. 

This is my own algorithm using a while loop to reverse the word and here is the example output:
```
Please enter a word: Programming
Programming spelt backwards is: gnimmargorP
```

## Exercise 2: LowerCase Converter
I created a simple C++ program that converts a user entered word to lower case. The program prompts
the user for a single word. Once entered, the program displays the message below and shows the word in
lower case.
```
Please enter a word: MaDaM
MaDaM converted to lower case is: madam

```
